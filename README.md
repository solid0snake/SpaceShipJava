# SpaceShip Java
<h6>
The program displays a ‘spaceship’ that follows the mouse and shoots ‘lasers’. In addition, the program keeps track of how many shots were fired. This ‘shot counter’ is controlled by a button that resets ‘shot counter’ to zero. There is another button that controls if audio is played or not.
